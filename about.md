This site represents the collective findings, analyses, and insights produced by students in [Stetson University's](https://www.stetson.edu/) *Big Data Mining and Analytics* course. The course projects usually address a topic that is relevant to the data science community and, in some cases, greater society. We decided to publicize our findings to benefit these communities while ensuring the class projects have long-term relevance beyond the classroom.
